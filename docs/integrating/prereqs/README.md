# Prerequisites

```{toctree}
:hidden:

vc
dotnet
xna
dx
```

Since we encourage developers to ship [portable builds](../platforms/windows.md), the app supports installing frameworks or libraries your game might depend on.

Here's how it looks for users:

## Adding prereqs to the manifest

The simplest possible manifest would look something like

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "play"
path = "Game.exe"
```

\(As a file named `.itch.toml` at the root of your game's folder. See [Manifest files](../manifest.md) for more details\)

Each prerequisite you want just needs its own `[[prereqs]]` entry. For example, if  
your game depends on XNA 4.0 and Visual C++ 2010, you could ship the following manifest:

```toml
[[actions]]
name = "play"
path = "Game.exe"

[[prereqs]]
name = "vcredist-2010-x86"

[[prereqs]]
name = "xna-4.0"
```

Prerequisites are not tied to any particular action â€” any time a "native executable" action  
is launched, prerequisites will be verified, and if needed, downloaded and installed.

## Available prerequisites

Each category of prerequisite has its own page:

* [Visual C++ Runtime](./vc.md)
* [.NET Framework](./dotnet.md)
* [XNA Framework](./xna.md)
* [DirectX](./dx.md)

If your game needs a prerequisite that's not on the list, please [open an issue](https://github.com/itchio/itch/issues/new) so we can add it to our repository.

Please consult the list of [requested prerequisites](https://github.com/itchio/itch/labels/prereqs) first to avoid opening duplicate requests!
