The first time the app starts, it will ask you for your itch.io username \(or e-mail\) and password.

```{note}
It is not possible to use the app anonymously at the moment, although downloading or even purchasing is possible on the _[https://itch.io](https://itch.io)_ website without an account.
```

## Captcha

You may have to fill in a captcha to complete the login procedure. This helps us keep the spammers at bay.

```{note}
We're as annoyed by this as you are. Sorry ðŸ˜ž.

We know you're not a robot. Robots don't read the docs!
```

## Two-factor authentication

If you have two-factor authentication enabled, the app will ask you for a one-time code.

## Multiple profiles

You can log in with multiple user accounts from the itch app. Each profile has its own set of browser tabs, has access to its own creations, etc.

However, downloads and installed games are shared between all profiles.
