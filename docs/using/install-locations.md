# Install locations

Install locations are folders that the itch app installs games to. The initial install location is in a folder your user has write access to without requiring administrator rights.

_That's why games aren't installed to _`Program Files`_ on Windows. As a rule, the app can be installed and used without ever asking for Administrator privileges, except for _[_sandbox setup_](sandbox.md)_ or third-party installers._

## Adding another install location

Click the "Manage install locations" button in the Preferences window, then click the "Add install location" button:

Whenever you install a game in the app, it will ask you where to install it.

(By default, it will pick the location you last installed to)
