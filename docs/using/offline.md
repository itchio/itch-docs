# Using itch offline

It is possible to use the itch app offline. If you've logged in at least once successfully before, you'll be able to pick a remembered profile and go from there.

If you just lose your network access while the app is running, it'll keep launching games, showing your collections, and searching your local library.

_Note: when offline, the main search bar won't display online results for reasons that are hopefully self-explanatory._
