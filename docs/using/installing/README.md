You can download the latest version of the app from [https://itch.io/app](https://itch.io/app).

Additionally, there are .deb and .rpm repositories, and AUR packages.

To learn more, refer to:

* [Installing on Windows](windows)
* [Installing on macOS](macos)
* [Installing on Linux](linux/README)

Release notes for all versions are available [on GitHub](https://github.com/itchio/itch/releases).

## Upgrading itch

On macOS and Windows, the app automatically updates itself, notifying you when it's ready to be restarted, with a list of changes:

On Linux, you currently have to download and install a newer package yourself, except if you're using our .deb or .rpm repository, although we are [working on an alternative](https://github.com/itchio/itchSetup).

You can check the currently running version of the app by hovering the `itch `logo in the top-left corner, or by opening Preferences.
