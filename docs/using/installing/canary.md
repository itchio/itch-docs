# The canary version

If you're interested in helping us kill bugs before they even reach the stable
version, you can check out [the canary channel](../../developing/continuous-deployment.md#the canary channel).

It's a bleeding-edge, often-updated version of the app with *no guarantee of
stability* that you can install in parallel with the stable app.
