# Environment Variables

These environment variables will change the behavior of the app:

* `DEVTOOLS=1` — start with Chromium Devtools open — useful when something goes
  wrong before the `F12` binding becomes available.
* `ITCH_LOG_LEVEL=debug` — see `logger/index` for available levels - defaults to "info"
* `DEBUG=butlerd:*` — show all debug messages related to communicating with the butler daemon.
* `MARCO_POLO=1` — dumps all redux events being dispatched throughout the app. We attempt to filter that but **please pay extra care to any logs you post publicly** to make sure you're not leaking your own credentials.
* `IMMEDIATE_NOSE_DIVE=1` - open dev tools before launching html games
* `UP_TO_SCRATCH=1` - force update checks, even in development environment
* `PROFILE_REQUIRE=1` - profile how much time it takes to require modules
* `ITCH_IGNORE_CERTIFICATE_ERRORS=1` - ignore certificate errors - USE WITH CARE only with debugging proxies that do SSL proxying
* `ITCH_EMULATE_OFFLINE=1` - simulate a network outage. This only affects itch, not butler.

See the [Performance hacking](/developing/performance.md) section for other environment variables that impact the app.
