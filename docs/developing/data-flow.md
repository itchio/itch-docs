# Data Flow

itch follows the [Redux](http://redux.js.org/index.html) design pattern — to understand the rest of this page,  
you need to be familiar with it. The basics are as follows:

* All state is stored in a single place \(the store\)
* All change happens via actions, that are dispatched by the store, to:
  * Reducers, which compute new state from the old state and the action
  * Reactors which are used in itch to apply side-effects
* The UI is rendered directly from the state

## Separate processes

Electron apps are a bit peculiar, because they have two types of processes:

* A single node.js process, that lives throughout the application's runtime
* Renderer processes, one per browser window \(or web contents, really\)

Thanks to Electron's `node-integration`, both of these can `require()` the same  
modules — but they're different copies, being executed by different JavaScript  
runtimes, completely isolated, so if you have a module like this:

```JavaScript
// my-module.js
module.exports = { prop: 'initial' }
```

And then do this in the renderer process:

```JavaScript
// this only affects the renderer's copy of `./my-module`
require('./my-module').prop = 'renderer!'
```

Then the following will still be true in the browser process:

```JavaScript
// the browser process is reading from its own copy of the module,
// which still has the initial value
require('./my-module').prop === 'initial'
```

## RPC

One way to communicate between the browser process and renderer processes  
is Electron's `remote` module, which gives you a reference to the remote version  
of a module. To continue on our example above:

```JavaScript
// in the renderer
var remote = require('electron').remote
remote.require('./my-module').prop = 'renderer'
```

RPC \(Remote Procedure Call\) is implemented under-the-hood with a special kind of JavaScript objects, which react to 'reading/writing properties' and calling methods by sending a synchronous IPC \(Inter-Process Communication\) call to the other process, and then waiting for the response.

This is fine for one-off calls on occasion, but isn't suitable for continuous data transfer throughout the application's lifecycle, as blocking both processes on every call is a serious performance penalty.

_It gets worse: imagine traversing a large object hierarchy — every field access results in a blocking IPC call._ One can mitigate this by serializing the object hierarchy to JSON and sending that over, in a single call. Depending on the size of the object to be sent, though \(all the application state, for example\), it might
