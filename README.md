## Note to developers

This documentation is built using [Sphinx](https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx) which is using python.
Activate a virtual environment with `.venv/Scripts/activate` and install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
Creating the compiled output then is as simple as running `make html` in the `docs` directory.
